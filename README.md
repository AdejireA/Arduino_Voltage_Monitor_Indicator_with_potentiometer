# Potentiometer Voltage Monitoring System

## Description
This Arduino sketch monitors the voltage output from a potentiometer connected to analog pin A0. It displays the voltage reading on the serial monitor and controls two LEDs based on the voltage level. If the voltage exceeds or equals 4.0 volts, indicating an extremely high level, it blinks a red LED. Otherwise, it blinks a green LED to signify a moderate level.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Potentiometer
- 2 LEDs (red and green)
- Resistors
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram
A schematic diagram showing how the components are connected is included.

## Installation
1. Connect the potentiometer to analog pin A0 of the Arduino board.
2. Connect the red LED to pin 8 and the green LED to pin 7.
3. Connect appropriate resistors in series with each LED to limit current.
4. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the Arduino board.

## Usage
1. Upon uploading the sketch, open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE or any compatible serial monitor application.
2. Rotate the potentiometer knob to vary the voltage.
3. The voltage reading and corresponding status (extremely high or moderate) will be displayed on the serial monitor.
4. The red LED will blink if the voltage is extremely high, and the green LED will blink otherwise.

## Customization
- Adjust the `delaytime` and `signaldelaytime` variables to change the blinking frequency of the LEDs.
- Modify the voltage threshold (`4.0` volts) in the `if` condition to set your desired threshold for determining an extremely high voltage.
